# SphaxHarvestcraft
A repository of images for the Sphax styled minecraft texture pack for Pam's Harvestcraft mod.

The spreadsheet that can re-create the script files is here:

If you find a problem with any images or scripts please open an issue.

If you can improve any of the four scripts please edit the file and make a pull request.

The images folder contains too many files for GitHub to display but the "find" feature works very nicely.

I don't beleive you can upload replacement images via the GitHub web app.  To suggest replacement or new images for this project you will have to fork the repository, download it to your machine, add or change the files and then sync to your fork.  Please then make a pull request to include your files in this fork.

Thank you.
